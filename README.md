# Aircraft Performance Evaluation Model

## Overview
The code here proposed is a a Python-based tool for evaluating the **Take-Off Distance Required (TODR)** and **air density** under varying atmospheric conditions (temperature, pressure, humidity, headwind) for a given aircraft-engine configuration at a specific airport.

It produce a Dataframe (structured as a 2D grid) with performance computed and the atmospheric conditions used as input.
It also generates 2D heatmap showing the performance variation with respect to any two input variablevariables, holding the others constant. 
This can be used for sensitivity studies, performance planning, or impact analysis of changing climate and weather conditions on aircraft takeoff performance.
The density of moist air is computed using the [A. Buck equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arden_Buck_equation).
Athmospheric variables considered are **Temperature, pressure, headwind and air humidity**.

## Key features
- Evaluate **air density and TODR** over a grid of environmental variables;

- Simulate performance for specific aircraft, engines, and airport configurations;

- Generate **2D performance maps** (e.g. temperature vs pressure, headwind vs pressure);

- **Custom configuration** via YAML;

- Modular design with reusable utilities for:

    - Aircraft performance,

    -   Atmospheric modeling,

    - Airport elevation and location;

- Styled plots with a custom matplotlib style.
